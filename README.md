# PDF RAG AI Agent

A **RAG-based PDF ingestion and query system** that leverages Python, LlamaIndex embeddings, and Qdrant for semantic search, allowing users to interact with PDFs via an AI-powered interface.

---

## Features

* **RAG-Based Query System:** Ingest PDFs and query content using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for accurate and context-aware answers.
* **Embeddings & Vector Search:** Uses **LlamaIndex** to generate embeddings and **Qdrant** as the vector database for fast semantic search.
* **End-to-End AI/LLM Workflows:** Asynchronous orchestration using **Pydantic models** and **context-aware prompting**.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with **Streamlit**, enabling non-technical users to upload documents, run queries, and visualize results.
* **Production-Ready Features:** Includes **rate limiting**, **concurrency handling**, and **workflow observability** for reliable operations.

## Usage

1. **Run the Streamlit app:**

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

2. **Upload PDFs** via the web interface.
3. **Ask questions** about the content and get answers generated by the RAG pipeline.
4. **View results** and interaction logs directly in the interface.
